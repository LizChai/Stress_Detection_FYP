# Aug 02 2021 - Week 2 Meeting

## Progress Update

* Resoldered GSR sensor after wire snapped from electrode
  * Wire was connection was tested
  * Sensor was tested (weird behaviour), non-sensible readings
  * Tried on both Arduino and ESP32
* HR sensors
  * Soldered and tried the two newer HR sensors taken from and old FYP
    * Doesn't seem to work on Arduino or ESP32
    * Glass covering on light is broken on one of the sensors
  * Just use intial HR sensor on Arduino (since that works)

## Todo

* Try fix electrodes
  * Check resistance/connectivity with wire (red) compared with black resistance
  * Try sticky AgCl electrodes
  * If still broken, order new sensor
* Just get hardware working
  * Just use Arduino (no wifi)

* Start thinking about assessment
  * Presentation, video, report, poster
  * Presentation questions
    * Hardware (why, what)
      * Portability, low-cost
    * Software
    * Data collection + processing (how)
      * Tested on other people
    * Experimentation
      * Stress vs other emotions
      * Tested on other people
      * Why GSR and HR
  * Poster
    * Hardware, experiment, result, big picture
