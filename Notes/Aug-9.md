* Created main software file that samples both HR and GSR

## To do

* Fix HR filtering and data sampling in software
* Enable Wifi
  * Source a LiPo
* Integrate sensor readings with machine learning script
* Record data
  * Me when demonstrating vs resting - record times
  * Write up experimental procedure
* Train other machine learning models
* Make the numbers mean something!!!
* Fabricate container for sensors, microcontroller and LiPo
* Start Final Assessments
