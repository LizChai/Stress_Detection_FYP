# Feb 03 2021 Meeting - Brainstorming

Liz and Yan

## Plan

* First 3 weeks:
  * Reading
    * Face-to-face discussions
    * Decide on 1-2 goals to achieve: i.e.
      * Recording signals, decoding movement
      * Then add ML
    * Create more detailed plan
* Week 4:
  * Risk assessment and Risk analysis Due
  * Afterwards:
    * Do the things
    * Weekly 1/2 hr meetings; every week or fortnight
      * Progress and to dos
      * Issues, requirements and help

## Project

* Monitoring body/self and adding extra ML application
  * Can start off with a send and end-goal
  * Or rewrite history at the end

## Ideas

* Multimodal info + non-overt movements > more complex signal for ML capability
* 'Overtness': measuring signals to move something, where you could just move it yourself < we don't want this
  * i.e. Using a sensor on the shoulder to detect finger movements
  * Find signals within signals
  * For noisy signals > DSP
* Sensors to use
  * Kinect, RealSense, Computer Vision
  * Camera
    * Filter for HR
    * CO2
    * Eye movements, emotions
  * Skin galvanic sensor: skin conductance, stress
    * Characterise stress > feedback > smart timer > scheduler (tells you do things or stop doing things), control what content you see
  * ECG

> Measure skin galvanic sensors > voltage amplifiers, camera (eye, facial emotion, poster, HR (also ECG)) > signal processing > stress

* In a study, usually get subject to sit in front of a screen > record stress 1-10
* Other ideas/applications:
  * Quadriplegic/amputee muscle rehab, restore movements
  * Habit forming/better self
  * Gaming rehab/posture/muscle activation
    * Psychological feedback

## To keep in mind

* Ethics
* Risk analysis
  * Shock from sensors
  * Ergonomics
* Requirements analysis
* Literature review
