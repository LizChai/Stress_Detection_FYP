# May 10 2021 - Progress Update

## Progress Update

* ML
  * Read papers on what/how researchers have converted their stress data into usable ML data (preprocessing/feature extraction)
  * Started implementing code for preprocessing and feature extraction

## To do

* Hardware
  * Look at wifi module
  * Potentially try out different HR sensor
  * Use oscilloscope to validate readings from GSR sensor
* Data
  * Plot data from GSR (in real-time)?
  * Start creating and implementing ML architecture
  * Give moving window a label from 1-10 based on how stressed
  * Continue coding ML pipeline
* Progress Report and Design Specification
  * No expectations from Yan
  * Write stuff that goes in the Final Report
