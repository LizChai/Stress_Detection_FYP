# May 24 2021 - Progress Update + Weekly Meeting

## Progress Update

* Hardware
  * Use oscilloscope to validate readings from GSR sensor
  * Back calculated GSR Resistance from (theoretical) analogue reading
* Data
  * Collected more data
* Assessment
  * Submitted Design Specification and Progress Report

## To do

* Hardware
  * Look at wifi module
  * Potentially try out different HR sensor
  * LiPo

* Data
  * Run against LDA, see if kNN performs better
  * Consider penalisation (LOO, validating on other data), how well a model works/make sure it doesn't overfit despite more parameters
    * Is it a better model?
    * LOO: is it another subject, unseen data
  * Try moving window a label, instead of whole time period
  * Create other ML models
  * Create spreadsheet + survey to record stress
  * Record more data
