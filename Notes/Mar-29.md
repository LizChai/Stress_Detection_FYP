# Mar 29 2021 - Week 5 Meeting

## Progress Update

* Submitted Requirements Analysis
  * Added more specific requirements
* Created environment for hardware
* Created machine learning environment
* Connected to hardware via UART to get readings from GSR
  * Got readings from the GSR
* Machine learning techniques
  * SVM
  * Decision trees
  * K-means clustering
  * Why: all three are used commonly in literature for stress detection, with high accuracy

## To do

* Hardware
  * Look at getting HR sensor working (I2C)
  * Look at wifi module
* Data
  * Plot data from GSR (in real-time)?
  * Start creating and implementing ML architecture

* How do the sensors actually work
* What do the numbers mean (i.e. linking to other people's work, validation (wet fingers, stress, etc))
