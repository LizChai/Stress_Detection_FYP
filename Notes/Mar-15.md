# Mar 15 2021 - Week 3 Meeting

## Progress Update

* Not much done since last Friday
* Read a little bit about EDA and PPG sensors (primarily for ECE4081 Sensors Report)
* Drafted Roadmap
* Risk Assessment
  * Medical device
    * Battery operated/battery-isolated
    * LiPo in a wearable
  * Ethics
    * Recording activity data
    * Recording blood oxygenation and skin conductance
  * Risks
    * Electrical electrocution > battery
    * Battery > protective case
    * Stress > not inducing stress
    * Ergonomics > take rests
  * Location: CL-16-Alliance Ln-Engineering 35-(35)-Ground Level-G01a

## To Do

1. Try to write/reuse/run code for ML (i.e from papers with code and datasets)
1. More researching Algorithms
    * Look at papers with code that use HRV and EDA datasets
    * Seen examples of simple Random Forest
1. Play with hardware when it arrives
    * Read datasheets
    * Plan pin mapping of sensors to microcontroller
1. Set up software environment/architecture for microcontroller
1. Set up software architecture/framework for data analysis
    * Data import format (csv/pandas?)
    * Data training/test split
    * Create Model
    * Fit Model
    * Train Model
1. Requirements Analysis
    * To write up roadmap in words
    * To write up literature review in words

## Questions for Yan (for meeting)

1. Expectations for Assessment due in Week 4 (Risk Assessment, Requirements Analysis) (I will need to refresh myself on what is needed)
    * How dangerous are LiPos in a wearable (Risk Assessment)?
    * Ethics of collecting stress data from myself/friends
    * Guidance/tips
1. Is my Roadmap okay?
1. Lab access?

## Thoughts

* Data Management
  * Semi real-time data collection and analysis
  * Or stored data and post-analysis
