* Started data collection
  * Me when demonstrating vs resting - record times
  * Write up experimental procedure

## Experimental procedure

* Todo

## Todo

* Experimental procedure
  * Stress labelled 1-10
* Think of FYP project name
  * Think of cool parts; HW, Data, SW
  * What is novel?
  * Stress Monitoring; low-cost

* Integrate sensor readings with machine learning script for prediction
* Record more data
* Train other machine learning models
* Make the numbers mean something!!!
* Fabricate container for sensors, microcontroller and LiPo
* Start Final Assessments
