# Mar 5 2021 - Week 1 Progress update

## Progress

1. Set up Note-taking environment
    * Set up Git
    * Chose to use Markdown for notes as this can be easily converted to LaTeX (or Word)
    * Can be added and tracked to Git
    * Can also be copy pasted into Moodle with correct formatting
1. Set up Mendeley for referencing
1. Confirmed expectations for Journal
    * Can be same as weekly progress email to Yan
    * Will probably plan to include my notes and research were applicable
1. Read through tips on Library Guides on Writing a Lit Review and other Resources on library website
1. Started reading articles for Literature Review
    * Found a few interesting articles with applications which I would like to try/use as a base/idea
      * i.e. Acute stress > HR monitor + skin galvanic data (+camera facial expressions) > ESP microcontroller > cloud > ML (SVM) > result > displayed via application/LED
      * Must consider exercise in algo and may also be able to detect overtraining in athletes
      * Thoughts:
        * Excited about IoT and edge computing with the stress detection algo
        * Stress detection algo seems okay to figure out/manage
          * Existing algos are quite basic, need to do more research in this area if its worth trying to make a more complicated/better one?
          * Or look to get a 'HD' elsewhere? i.e. application?
        * Can only use facial expression camera data if participant is in front of computer/sitting > student studying application or business office-worker application
        * Some people collected stress data from participants in a Hackathon, what are the ethics?
    * Read about types of stress and how they occur physiologically

## To Do

1. Read more papers
    * Types of stress (i.e. acute)
    * How to test for and record stress data (i.e. stroop test)
    * Uses and applications of each of the metrics (skin sensor, CV, ECG)
    * Stuff already out there with a similar application
1. Find Open Source dataset (if applicable)
    * Transforming data, spectral analysis, PCA/LDA
1. Research Algorithm (this depends on what sensor data I collect)
    * SVM/PCA/classical ML for HR and skin galvanic sensors
    * CNNs for facial expression data
    * Train ensemble neural network using classical ML (sensor data) output and CNN (facial expressions) for higher accuracy?
1. Reflect + figure out what I want to do in life, so I know where I can focus on the project; something along the lines of:
    * Medical application + Data + ML + IoT sensors/hardware
    * Edge or cloud computing
1. Come up with a concrete idea by next week
    * Idea
    * Architecture, hardware, software
