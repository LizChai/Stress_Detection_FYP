### Tips

1. Know your Purpose
    * read to: gain an overview, find specific info, understand difficult concepts, revise for exams, complete assignment
1. Be selective of what you read and focus on the question or task
    * identifiy key words, or phrases, questions to be answered
1. Break reading into segments
1. Keeping track of what you have read
    * Keep details of: author, title, place of publication, date and page numbers

### Effective reading strategies

* Previewing, Skimming, Scanning, Detailed Reading

### Content

1. Author:
    * main theme
    * authority, attitude and stance
1. Content:
    * main point
    * factual information
    * supporting evidence
    * assumptions

   * Influcence of style and format on reaction to reading

### Note taking methods

* Resource summary matrix
  * Citation (inc page numbers), main issue or problem, aim, conclusion reached, evidence provided from the author, other research concepts, keywords
* Cornell note taking format: keywords, descriptions+diagrams, weekly summary

## Literature Review

## Notes

Report options

* LaTeX (with BibTeX) <- Will try this first and see how this goes
* Word + in-built referencing
* Word + Mendeley
  * Word is potentially laggy

## Progress

1. Set up Note-taking environment
    * Set up Git
    * Chose to use Markdown for notes as this can be easily converted to LaTeX (or Word)
    * Can be added and tracked to Git
    * Can also be copy pasted into Moodle with correct formatting
1. Confirmed expectations for Journal
    * Can be same as weekly progress email to Yan

## To Do

1. Read through tips on Library Guides on Writing a Lit Review

1. Read papers

    * Uses and applications of each of the metrics (skin sensor, CV, ECG)
    * Types of stress
    * Stuff already out there with a similar application

1. Find Open Source dataset

    * Transforming data, spectral analysis, PCA/LDA

1. Algorithm
