# Assessment Actvities - Sem 1

## Project Journal - Ongoing

Students must regularly (weekly) update their "Project Journal" on Moodle with reflections and updates on their project progress.

## Literature Review

As part of any project (whether it be research or design based), you will need to conduct a "literature review" either of academic or "grey" literature, that makes you aware of the current "state-of-the-art" technologies that relate to your project. This is so you can make informed choices about the direction of your project, what kinds of techniques or solutions have been previously tried and failed/worked so you don't waste time and effort on things that don't work.

## Risk Analysis Documentation - Week 4

This Milestone is an initial investigation of the Safety Risks involved in the project. This item is continually updated during the life of the project to reflect new or changed risk circumstances as the project progresses. It is a legal requirement of all projects.

* S.A.R.A.H System > PDF Submission
* Deposit risk assessment in revelant lab
* Shock from sensors
* Ergonomics
* Can be done in an afternoon

## Requirements Analysis - Week 4

This Milestone is used to ensure both the student and supervisor have a common understanding of the direction, focus and outcomes intended from the project. It will be used as benchmark during the final presentation of findings.

* More specific = better; tick off requirements :)
* Need to become knowledgeable on background of project
* Set goals that correspond to different final grade levels
* Literature Review!

## Design Specification - Week 12

This Milestone is used to compare and contrast the final project result with initial expectations. The review panel will use this Milestone to examine what has been delivered and what was originally expected.

## Progress Report - Week 12

This Milestone is a brief report on the progress to date of the project. It should be no more than 5 pages.

* Have something completed by at least Week 10, for feedback from Yan (for big things)
