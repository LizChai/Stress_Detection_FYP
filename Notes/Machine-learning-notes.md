# Machine learning Development Notes

## Apr 12 2021

* Machine learning techniques
  * SVM (Support vector machines)
  * Decision trees
  * k-NN
  * Why: all three are used commonly in literature for stress detection, with high accuracy

* Literature Review Source 6:
  * Feature extraction techniques
    * Fourier transforms
    * Wavelet transforms
      * Both remove noise and extract important components
* Literature Review Source 2:
  1. Normalisation, Filtering, Feature Extraction
  1. Annotation
  1. Train-test split
  1. Model traning
  1. Test model
  1. Performance evaluation
  * Consider window size: i.e. 120 seconds
* Literature Review Source 13:
  * General characteristics used in data:
    * amplitude, standard deviation, min and max values, RMS and delay between stimulus and response, number of peaks, peak height, rising time, recovery time and position of min and max
  * Signal processing/noise removal
    * Kalman, Butterworth LPF, median, Wiener and wavelet decomposition
* Literature Review Source 16:
  * Sweat glands: eccrince, apocrine and apoeccrine
    * Eccrine glands are related to emotional response and innervated by sympathetic nerves which accompany psychological processes
    * Magnitude of sweating depends on sweat gland density, relative size and output of individual glands
  * SCL: skin conductance level
    * describes overall conductivity of skin over longer time intervals, over of several minutes
  * SCR: skin conductance responses per minute
    * describes frequency of occurrence of skin conductance responses
    * short fluctuations in skin conductance that lasts several seconds
    * usually follows a characteristic pattern of inital, relatively steep rise, short peak and then relatively slower return to baseline
  * S-AMPL: sum of skin conductance response amplitudes per minute
    * accounts for strength of skin conductance responses
