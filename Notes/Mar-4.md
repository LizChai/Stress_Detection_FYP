# Mar 4 2021 - Research + Lit Review Notes

## Literature Review

* [Link](https://www.monash.edu/rlo/graduate-research-writing/write-the-thesis/introduction-literature-reviews)
* Lit rev: identifies, evaluates and synthesises relevant literature in a particular field
  * Multiple texts, reference list, in-text referencing
  * Synthesised reviews
  * Purpose is to evaluate research on specific topic
* Functions as a tool to:
  * provide a background to your work by summarising the previously  published work
  * classify the research into different categories and demonstrate how the research in a particular area has changed over time by indicating historical background (early research findings in an area) as well as explaining recent developments in an area
  * clarify areas of controversy and agreement between experts in the area as well as identify dominant views
  * evaluate the previous research and identify gaps (i.e. unexplored areas)
  * help justify your research by indicating how it is different from other works in the same area
* Process:

 1. locate relevant lit: identify key texts
 1. review lit: read key texts, analyse & evaulate critically
 1. write about lit: synthesise and organise

## Progress

1. Set up Note-taking environment
    * Set up Git
    * Chose to use Markdown for notes as this can be easily converted to LaTeX (or Word)
    * Can be added and tracked to Git
    * Can also be copy pasted into Moodle with correct formatting
1. Confirmed expectations for Journal
    * Can be same as weekly progress email to Yan
1. Started reading articles for Literature Review

## To Do

1. Read through tips on Library Guides on Writing a Lit Review
1. Read papers
    * Uses and applications of each of the metrics (skin sensor, CV, ECG)
    * Types of stress
    * Stuff already out there with a similar application
1. Find Open Source dataset
    * Transforming data, spectral analysis, PCA/LDA

1. Research Algorithm

## Questions for Yan

1. Is the Literature Review assessed? Or does it just help us with our Design Spec?

* Progress + Final  report: intro, lit, results, conclusion
* Requirements Analysis: background + what you are going to do, include lit review

## Meeting with Yan

1. What type of ML? What novetly are we applying it to?
    * i.e. CV for emotions
    * i.e. CV for tiredness/stress
1. What do we know?
    * Camera > recording + another sensor
1. What do I need to do?
    * Figure out what I want to do in life, so I know where I can focus on the project
    * Concrete idea by next week
    * Look at data sources, i.e. gather own data or existing datasets
      * Cognitive stress test - i.e. stroop
1. Notes
   * Must remember to send Yan an update on Friday
   * Must remember to come prepared to meetings (i.e. slide, questions)
